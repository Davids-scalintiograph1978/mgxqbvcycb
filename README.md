OMG, just got back from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Henry Danger: The Movie and like, wow. You know what I mean? It's like, they crammed all the crazy we know and love into one epic, over-the-top   sandwich. 😂 Like, seriously, I wasn't ready for that whole plot twist with Charlotte. I mean, what was she even thinking half the time?

So, they went all out with their gadgets but was anyone else thinking, like, maybe less superhero stuff, more of those awkward moments between Captain Man and Kid Danger? 🤣 It's like, those two have a vibe that never gets old. But duh, it's a superhero flick so kaboom moments all over the place. The theater was like, half kids, half adults thinking they're kids.

> Anyway, the villain was such a cliche, but kinda in a good way, you know? Like, you could almost see them twirling their mustache, if they had one. 😂 But the action scenes, man, they got me. I was on the edge of my seat. Although, gotta admit, I may have snoozed through those talking parts. Whoops.

Oh, and remember how we talked about maybe just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and chill at home? Kind of wish I did that cuz now I'm too wired to sleep. 🙈 Still, can't deny how amazing 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it on the big screen was. Loud noises, popcorn, people yelling – the whole cinema vibe, you dig?

Idk, there was just something about seeing the whole crew back together that was like, warm, fuzzy, and a lil cringey in that way we all secretly love. They even managed to throw in some lessons, like usual, hidden under the layers of mess and chaos. 

let adventureRoutine = (popcorn) => stayAwake;

Anyway, after all this, I might need to binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the series again. But first, hitting the sack ‘cause I’m wiped out. Text me in the morning, maybe we can rant more about it. 🎬
